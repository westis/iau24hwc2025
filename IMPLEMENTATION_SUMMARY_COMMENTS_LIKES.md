# Or manually in Supabase Dashboard:
# 1. Go to SQL Editor
# 2. Copy contents of migrations/015_news_comments_likes.sql
# 3. Execute the SQL
```

### Optional Enhancements

Consider adding in the future:

## 🧪 Testing Checklist

Before deploying to production:

- [ ] Run the database migration
- [ ] Test anonymous user experience (can view, prompted to sign in)
- [ ] Test authenticated user experience (can comment and like)
- [ ] Test comment editing (own comments only)

- [ ] Test banned user restrictions
- [ ] Test on mobile devices
- [ ] Test both English and Swedish translations
- [ ] Test error handling (network failures, validation errors)
- [ ] Verify RLS policies work correctly

## 🔧 Configuration

No additional environment variables needed. The system uses existing Supabase configuration:
