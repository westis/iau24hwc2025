# How to Set Preview Article Links

## Quick Guide (2 minutes)

### Step 1: Find Your Article IDs

1. Go to `/admin/news` on your site
2. Look at the news articles list - **the first column shows the ID number**
3. Note which article is your:
   - **Men's preview** (e.g., ID: 5)
   - **Women's preview** (e.g., ID: 8)

### Step 2: Update the Code

1. Open: `iau24hwc-app/app/participants/page.tsx`
2. Find this section (around line 100-104):

```typescript
// Preview article links - configure these to match your news article IDs
const previewLinks = {
  men: "/news/1", // Replace with actual men's preview article ID
  women: "/news/2", // Replace with actual women's preview article ID
};
```

3. **Change the numbers** to match your article IDs:

```typescript
const previewLinks = {
  men: "/news/5", // ‚Üê Replace 1 with your men's preview ID
  women: "/news/8", // ‚Üê Replace 2 with your women's preview ID
};
```

4. Save the file

### Step 3: Push to GitHub

```bash
git add app/participants/page.tsx
git commit -m "Update preview article links"
git push origin main
```

## Example

If your news admin page shows:

| ID    | Title                    | Published |
| ----- | ------------------------ | --------- |
| 3     | Race Schedule            | ‚úÖ        |
| **5** | **Men's Race Preview**   | ‚úÖ        |
| **8** | **Women's Race Preview** | ‚úÖ        |
| 12    | Latest Updates           | ‚úÖ        |

Then set:

```typescript
const previewLinks = {
  men: "/news/5",
  women: "/news/8",
};
```

## Alternative: Check URL When Viewing Article

1. Go to your public site
2. Click on the preview article in the news feed
3. Look at the URL: `https://yoursite.com/news/5`
4. The number at the end is the ID!

## Need to Create the Preview Articles?

1. Go to `/admin/news`
2. Click **"Create News"**
3. Write your preview article
4. Click **"Publish"**
5. Note the ID from the news list
6. Repeat for the other gender's preview
7. Update the config as described above

That's it! The banner will automatically show the correct preview based on which gender tab is selected. üéØ
