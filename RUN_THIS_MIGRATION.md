## Quick Check: What Tables Should Exist

After running the migration, you should have these tables in Supabase:

1. **news_comments** - Stores user comments

   - id, news_id, user_id, comment, created_at, updated_at, deleted_at, deleted_by

2. **news_likes** - Stores article likes
   - id, news_id, user_id, created_at
   - Has UNIQUE constraint on (news_id, user_id)

Both tables should have:

- Row Level Security (RLS) enabled
- Multiple RLS policies for different user roles
- Indexes for performance
