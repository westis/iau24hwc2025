## üîê Security & Compliance

### GDPR Requirements Met

| Requirement | How We Comply |
|-------------|---------------|
| **Explicit Consent** | User must click confirmation link in email |
| **Easy Opt-Out** | Unsubscribe link in every notification email |
| **Data Minimization** | Only store email + necessary tokens |
| **Transparency** | Clear language about what they're subscribing to |
| **Right to Be Forgotten** | Soft delete (enabled=false) allows resubscription |
| **Audit Trail** | Track subscribed_at, confirmed_at timestamps |

### Token Security

- **Generation:** `crypto.randomBytes(32).toString("hex")` - 64 chars
- **Storage:** Unique indexed column in database
- **Usage:** Single-use (token doesn't change after confirmation)
- **Expiration:** Not enforced in DB (relies on user common sense)

---

## üß™ Testing Checklist

### Initial Setup

- [x] Verify `RESEND_API_KEY` in environment variables
- [x] Verify `RESEND_FROM_EMAIL` domain is verified
- [x] Verify `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` is correct

### User Flow Testing

- [ ] **Subscribe:** Enter email on banner ‚Üí See "Bekr√§fta din e-postadress"
- [ ] **Email Received:** Check inbox for confirmation email from "IAU 24h WC 2025"
- [ ] **Confirm:** Click "Bekr√§fta prenumeration" button in email

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### No confirmation email received

**Check these in order:**

1. **Spam folder** - Most common issue
2. **Resend domain verified** - [Resend Dashboard](https://resend.com/domains)
3. **Resend logs** - [Resend Dashboard](https://resend.com/emails) ‚Üí Check for errors
4. **From email matches domain** - `RESEND_FROM_EMAIL` must use verified domain
5. **API key correct** - `RESEND_API_KEY` in Vercel environment

**Debug SQL:**
```sql
SELECT email, confirmed, confirmation_token, subscribed_at
FROM email_subscriptions
WHERE email = 'test@example.com';
```

### "Invalid or expired confirmation token"

**Causes:**
- User already confirmed (check `confirmed` field)
- Token regenerated (user subscribed again before confirming)
- Typo in URL

**Fix:**
- Subscribe again to get new token
- Check database for `confirmed = true`

### Confirmed user not receiving notifications

**Check:**
```sql
SELECT email, confirmed, enabled
FROM email_subscriptions
WHERE email = 'test@example.com';
```

**Both must be true:**
- `confirmed = true`
- `enabled = true`

**Also check:**
- Resend API logs for send errors
- Resend free tier quota (3,000/month)

## üìä Admin Monitoring

### Count subscriber states

```sql
SELECT
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE confirmed = true AND enabled = true) AS active,
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE confirmed = false) AS pending,
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE enabled = false) AS unsubscribed,
  COUNT(*) AS total
FROM email_subscriptions;
```

### See who's pending confirmation

```sql
SELECT
  email,
  subscribed_at,
  ROUND(EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (NOW() - subscribed_at)) / 3600, 1) AS hours_ago
FROM email_subscriptions
WHERE confirmed = false
ORDER BY subscribed_at DESC;
```

### See recent confirmations

```sql
SELECT email, confirmed_at
FROM email_subscriptions
WHERE confirmed = true
ORDER BY confirmed_at DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

## üîÑ Comparison: Email vs Push Notifications

| Feature | Email (Double Opt-In) | Push (OneSignal) |
|---------|----------------------|------------------|
| **Reliability** | 99.9% | 60-70% (browser dependent) |
| **Setup** | Medium | Medium |
| **User Friction** | 2 clicks (subscribe + confirm) | 1 click (allow) |
| **Works Everywhere** | ‚úÖ Yes | ‚ùå Desktop + Android only |
| **Persistent** | ‚úÖ In inbox | ‚ùå Disappears |
| **GDPR** | ‚úÖ Built-in | ‚ö†Ô∏è Manual |
| **Cost (Free Tier)** | 3,000/month | Unlimited |
| **Best For** | Infrequent important updates | Real-time app notifications |

**Recommendation for IAU 24h WC:**
- **Primary:** Email (more reliable, everyone has email)
- **Secondary:** Push (optional for power users)
