# Comments & Likes Feature for News Articles

## 🎯 Overview

I've successfully added a complete comments and likes system to your news articles, fully integrated with your existing Supabase authentication from the chat feature. Users can now engage with your news content using the same Google OAuth login they use for chat.

## ✨ Features Implemented

### For All Users (Not Signed In)

- View like counts on articles
- Read all comments on articles
- See user avatars and names on comments
- Prompted to sign in when trying to interact

### For Signed-In Users

- **Like/Unlike** articles (one like per user per article)
- **Post Comments** with up to 5000 characters
- **Edit Own Comments** anytime
- See their Google profile picture next to their comments
- Real-time character counter
- Relative timestamps (e.g., "2 hours ago")

### For Admins

- **Delete Any Comment** (soft delete)
- **View All Activity** including deleted comments
- **Moderate Content** effectively

### For Banned Users

- Cannot like or comment
- Can still view content
- See clear "banned" message

## 📦 What's Included

5. `GET /api/news/[id]/likes` - Get like info
6. `POST /api/news/[id]/likes` - Like article
7. `DELETE /api/news/[id]/likes` - Unlike article

## 🔧 Configuration

No new environment variables needed! Uses your existing:

- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
- `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`

## 📱 User Flow Example

1. User visits `/news/123`
2. Sees article with like button and comments
3. Clicks "Like" → Prompted to sign in
4. Signs in with Google (same as chat)
5. Can now like/unlike and comment
6. Can edit their own comments
7. Sees other users' comments with avatars

## 🔐 Admin Setup

To make a user an admin:

```sql
-- In Supabase Dashboard SQL Editor
UPDATE chat_users
SET is_admin = true
WHERE email = 'admin@example.com';
```

Admins can:

- Delete any comment
- View all comments (including deleted)
- Manage banned users

## 📊 Database Schema

```sql
news_comments (
  id BIGSERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  news_id INTEGER → news(id),
  user_id UUID → chat_users(id),
  comment TEXT,
  created_at TIMESTAMP,
  updated_at TIMESTAMP,
  deleted_at TIMESTAMP,  -- soft delete
  deleted_by UUID
)

news_likes (
  id BIGSERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  news_id INTEGER → news(id),
  user_id UUID → chat_users(id),
  created_at TIMESTAMP,
  UNIQUE(news_id, user_id)  -- one like per user
)
```
